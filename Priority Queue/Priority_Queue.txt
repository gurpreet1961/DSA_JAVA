A priority queue is a special type of queue in which each element is associated with
a priority and is served according to its priority. If element with the same priority
occur, they are served according to their order in the queue.



In a queue, the first-in-first-out rule is implemented whereas, in a priority
queue, the values are removed on the basis of priority. The element with the highest priority
is removed first.
